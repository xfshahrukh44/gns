            "description": "\n\t\n\t<p>We’ve been getting quite a few general inquiries on the Profile Zcoaster and Madera Gulf Coaster.</p>\n<p>Because both hubs are so similar, we’ve made a Q and A list below, applying to both that will hopefully clarify any questions you may have on either hub.</p>\n<p>For anything more detailed or not covered here, feel free to contact us at info@profileracing.com</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Q: My Zcoaster/Gulf Coaster is not engaging, what can I do to fix this?</strong></p>\n<p>A: This is the most common FAQ, and it’s a simple fix. The Profile ZCoaster works properly only when the Jam nuts are fully tightened. When taking your wheel off, say, to replace a flat tire, the jam nuts may become slightly loose; and that’s all it takes. Make sure they’re tightened back, and you’ll be on your way back into the session.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I put grease in my driver, like I would in a traditional Freecoaster?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Considering the ZCoaster is a cassette hub that disengages into a freecoaster, like all cassettes, it works BEST DRY. You can, however, put a little bit of clear lube on the spring and pawl pockets, but NO GREASE. Grease will jam up the hub’s engagement and potentially destroy the hub.</p>\n<p>*Light oil is also recommended in the driver (we do apply some when building the hub) to initially break in the hub once new or when a new driver is installed.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the extra tube spacer that came with the Zcoaster/Gulf Coaster when I bought it?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Does that tube have laser etching identifying it as a “cassette spacer?” If so, this piece can be switched out internally with the “ZCoaster Flat Spring Spacer” to turn your Zcoaster fully into a cassette.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When first getting my ZCoaster/Gulf Coaster hub or my ZCoaster/Gulf Coaster wheel, as I hold it in my hand and spin the hub, it seems to not engage.</strong></p>\n<p>A: In order for the ZCoaster to work/Engage properly, the hub/wheel needs to be tightened into your frame’s drop outs. Once tightened, you should be good to go!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should I do about this grease that is on the hub shell support bearing near the driver?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When Initially built, the hub is compressed, which puts pressure on the bearings. After a short while, that compression will cause grease to weep from the support bearing which is completely normal. Go ahead and wipe the grease away and you’re good to go!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41894\" src=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"507\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-100x61.jpg 100w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-245x150.jpg 245w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-530x323.jpg 530w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-401x245.jpg 401w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy-600x366.jpg 600w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_9405-copy.jpg 957w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\"></p>\n\t\n\t\t\t"

The larger, heat treated crank arms provide a much more rigid crank. And the extremely hollow, 22mm GDH spindle is our best defense against twisting over time: the larger diameter allows us to take more meat out of the center, creating a lighter, much more rigid design.<br>\nProfile team members (for style reference) that ride 22mm Column cranks: Mark Mulville, Dillon Leeper, Rob DiQuattro, Zach Rogers, Eric Holladay, Shane Leeper, Anthony Napolitan, Riley Jordan, and Brian Fox.<br>\nProfile 22mm Column cranks are warrantied for life to the original purchaser.<br>\n*Titanium spindles are not warrantied.</p>\n<p>Overall, the two main factors in crank selection are rigidity/strength and weight.<br>\nWe hope the info above can help you choose.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28242\" src=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"Column Chrome Set copy\" width=\"717\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-300x257.jpg 300w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-600x514.jpg 600w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-768x658.jpg 768w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-1040x892.jpg 1040w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-100x86.jpg 100w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-245x210.jpg 245w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-530x454.jpg 530w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1-286x245.jpg 286w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Column-Chrome-Set-copy-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\"></p>\n\t\n\t\t\t"

heat-treated chromoly tubing as opposed to forged aluminum.<br>\n– Unlike other cranks on the market, the triangular gusset of the Elite arms eliminates any chance of the arm flexing from side to side or downward to deliver maximum pedal power.<br>\n– The Elite cranks come standard with a 22mm Ti axle, giving the Elite cranks the status of being one of the lightest cranks on the market.<br>\n– Bottom bracket uses 22mm cartridge bearings for less spinning resistance and increased durability.<br>\n– 3-piece crank construction: You can change arm sizes, replace damaged arms or spider/chainwheel without buying a new crankset (an advantage over 2-piece designs).<br>\n– Instead of using a spider, Profile offers the Sabre, one piece sprocket as an alternative drive train in sizes 36 through 45t.<br>\n– Lifetime warranty on crank arms and spindle.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“When it’s time to choose cranks, you have plenty of choices, but one crank stands above the rest. American made for 50 years. Profile Racing Elite Crank set is lightweight, indestructible, and the stiffest crank on the market. Why wouldn’t you get a crankset that has all that and will last forever and they even come in a rad container!”</p>\n<p>– &nbsp;&nbsp;Drew Motley</p>\n\t\n\t\t\t"

For instance, the same spline inserts are used for both Madera and Profile Splined Sprockets, the same GDH spindles are used between both line’s 19 and 22mm crank selection, and as these two videos show, both Madera V-2 and Profile Mini/Totem rear cassette hubs have the exact same internals.</p>\n<p>But, what brings the cost down on Madera’s line is production and post production aesthetics. Madera V-2 rear hub shells take 5 minutes in our machines where, Profile Mini rear hub shells take 7-1/2. That 2-1/2 minute difference in machine time equals a substantial cost savings over time. For instance, throughout the day, our shop would make 56 Rear Profile shells as compared to 80 Madera V-2 shells.</p>\n<p>Instead of utilizing engraving (like we do on quite a bit of the Profile line), we handle a lot of Madera’s post production in the laser etching machine. For instance, laser etching Madera’s logo on the V-2 hub takes about 20 seconds where the three “Wing P” logos on the Profile Mini takes up around 1/3 of the entire production time of the shell.</p>\n<p>With Madera, we also stray away from polishing as a base coat for anodizing. Polishing is done by hand, is extremely rigorous and time consuming…with that in mind we tend to lean towards either media blasting (Madera’s Matte Red and Snow Colorways) or paint (Madera’s Celestial and Party paint Colorway) as a base coat</p>\n<hr>\n<p>So, in essence, if you like the idea of your parts being made in the USA, but you’re on a budget, that’s where Madera comes into play.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us and thanks for the support!</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"660\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFYwDpdLK0E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n\t\n\t\t\t"

The small bearing keeps everything close and tight into your frame.</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br>\nThe outboard bottom bracket still works with the euro bottom bracket shell, but now uses a larger bearing that sits outside the frame. The larger bearing puts less stress on the bottom bracket bearings which, in turn, lets it spin smoother and faster. The outboard bottom bracket doesn’t work too well with imperial style sprockets: it sets the sprocket out a little bit further so it is harder to get the chain line straight. With that being said, the ultimate set up would be the outboard bottom bracket with the spline driven 4-bolt spider and the profile elite chainring (which has off set teeth to help the chain line even more).<p></p>\n<p>I always suggest chasing the bottom bracket on any frame before installing ether style bottom bracket.”<br>\n</p>\n<div class=\"m_-5414805571047639268gmail-m_-151428160720770197m_8338740889526427181gmail-m_8667495210138404460gmail_signature\"></div>\n</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">-Chad Powers (Powers Bike Shop)</span></strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">——————————<wbr>——-</span></div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;“</span>Pros on the Outboard BB: Easy to thread in if you prep correctly &amp; thread it in straight, there is no pressing involved and I love that aspect with outboard bottom brackets.</div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cons on the Outboard BB: I haven’t proven it, but I definitely go through many more outboard BBs than mid bottom brackets.

You can always jump higher with your feet closer together.</div>\n<div>2. Ambidextrous spinning: It’s much easier to 180 (360, 540 etc…) both ways with your feet closer together.</div>\n<div>3. Lighter weight: The shorter the crank, the less steel used in its tubular construction.</div>\n<div>4.

This can cause a slight “clicking” noise, which means the drive mechanism is trying to engage. In that case, we recommend using a 115 degree slack ring (1/2 crank back to disengage, 1/3 crank forward to engage).<br>\nYou might have to try two slack rings to see what is best for your style of riding. And when doing so, always choose more slack to begin with, and you can adjust from there if you need to.</div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530.jpg\" data-rel=\"lightbox-gallery-pTJmhLoI\" data-rl_title=\"\" data-rl_caption=\"\" title=\"\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22725\" src=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530.jpg 640w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530-600x800.jpg 600w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530-100x133.jpg 100w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530-184x245.jpg 184w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530-398x530.jpg 398w, https://www.profileracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_0530-245x327.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></a></div>\n<div>\n<div id=\":k2\" class=\"ii gt adP adO\">\n<div id=\":k1\" class=\"a3s aXjCH m1597047b20eb6c96\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"gmail_quote\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"gmail_quote\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<div>Here’s some personal feedback from our riders.</div>\n<div>We hope this helps…</div>\n<div>Thanks for the support!</div>\n<div>————————-</div>\n</div>\n<div>“I run the 90 degree slack ring because I want to make sure I have the most difference between the two settings.
